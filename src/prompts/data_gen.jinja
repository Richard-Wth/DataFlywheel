You are given a bad-case math question and its attribution (error analysis). Use them only as context.

Task:
1) Create a NEW math question that is clearly different from the original (not a paraphrase or trivial number swap), but targets a similar topic and difficulty.
2) Solve your NEW question with a correct, complete reasoning process and final answer.

Hard rules:
- Do NOT output JSON.
- Do NOT restate or paraphrase the original question.
- The new question must be unambiguous and have a single correct final answer.
- Use the attribution to avoid the same failure mode.
- The reasoning must be correct and consistent with the final answer. Verify before you finish.
- The new question must be complete and self-contained (include all needed data in one coherent statement).
- Output format (must follow strictly):
  a) A line starting with `New question:` followed by your new problem.
  b) A single `<think>...</think>` block containing the reasoning steps.
  c) After `</think>`, write the solution (can be short), and end with a line containing `**Final Answer:** ...`.
  d) The `**Final Answer:** ...` line must be the last thing you write.
  e) The final answer MUST be wrapped in `\\boxed{...}` and appear on the `**Final Answer:**` line.
  f) Ensure the final answer is a single, unambiguous value/expression consistent with the solution.
