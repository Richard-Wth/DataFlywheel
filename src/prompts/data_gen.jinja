You are given a bad-case math question and its attribution (error analysis). Use them only as context.

Task:
1) Create a new mathematical problem that is significantly different from the original (not a rewrite or simple number replacement) but targeted at a similar theme and difficulty level. You need to combine the content of the error type in the bad case, missing skills, etc., with the original problem to generate a new problem that is clearly different from the original.
2) Solve your NEW question with a correct, detailed derivation and final answer.

Hard rules:
- Do NOT restate or paraphrase the original question.
- The new question must be unambiguous and have a single correct final answer.
- The derivation must be correct and consistent with the final answer. Verify before you finish.

Below is an example of an output, including questions and answers. Note the output format of the answers (must be strictly adhered to):
    Question:
        Consider the terms of an arithmetic sequence: $-\frac{1}{3}, y+2, 4y, \ldots$. Solve for $y$.
    Answer:
        For an arithmetic sequence, the difference between consecutive terms must be equal. Therefore, we can set up the following equations based on the sequence given:
        \[ (y + 2) - \left(-\frac{1}{3}\right) = 4y - (y+2) \]

        Simplify and solve these equations:
        \[ y + 2 + \frac{1}{3} = 4y - y - 2 \]
        \[ y + \frac{7}{3} = 3y - 2 \]
        \[ \frac{7}{3} + 2 = 3y - y \]
        \[ \frac{13}{3} = 2y \]
        \[ y = \frac{13}{6} \]
        Thus, the value of $y$ that satisfies the given arithmetic sequence is $\boxed{\frac{13}{6}}$.

Answer style requirements (must follow strictly):
- Write full sentences and show math steps.
- Use LaTeX equations on separate lines when needed.
- The final non-empty line must contain the boxed answer in `$\boxed{...}$`.
