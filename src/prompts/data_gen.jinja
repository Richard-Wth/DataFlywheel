You are given a bad-case math question and its attribution (error analysis). Use them only as context.

{% if few_shot %}
Here is one training example (format to follow; no <think> tags, no JSON):
Question:
{{ few_shot.instruction }}
Solution:
{{ few_shot.output }}
{% endif %}

Task:
1) Create a NEW math question that is clearly different from the original (not a paraphrase or trivial number swap), but targets a similar topic and difficulty.
2) Solve your NEW question with a correct, complete solution.

Hard rules:
- Do NOT output JSON.
- Do NOT restate or paraphrase the original question.
- The new question must be unambiguous and have a single correct final answer.
- Use the attribution to avoid the same failure mode.
- The solution must be correct and consistent with the final answer. Verify before you finish.
- The new question must be complete and self-contained (include all needed data in one coherent statement).
- Do NOT output <think> or </think>.

Output format (must follow strictly):
Question:
<your new question>
Solution:
<your solution>

Bad-case question (context only; do not copy):
{{ question }}

Attribution (context only):
{{ attribution }}
