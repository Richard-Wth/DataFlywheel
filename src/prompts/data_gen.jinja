You are given an original math question and its correct final answer.

Task: Write a detailed, fully correct solution for the SAME question, using the given answer as ground truth to verify and fix your work.

Hard rules:
- Do NOT output JSON.
- Do NOT output any special tags such as `<|begin_of_thought|>...`, `<|begin_of_solution|>...`, `<think>...</think>`, or XML tags.
- Do NOT restate the question. Only output the solution/answer.
- Your final line MUST be the final answer wrapped in `\\boxed{...}` and it MUST be the last thing you write.
- The content inside your final `\\boxed{...}` MUST match the given answer (mathematically equivalent). If needed, rewrite it into an equivalent simplified form.

Original question (for reference; do not rewrite it in your output):
{{ question }}

Correct final answer (use as ground truth; do not output it verbatim unless it is the final boxed line):
{{ answer }}
